### Project Overview

 # Moving Residence Analysis(Melbourne)


### Learnings from the project

 - Train Test split function.
- Calculating the Correlation between the features.
- Creating a Linear Regression model.
- Checking Polynomial Features.
- Lasso Regressor.
- Ridge Regressor.
- Calculating R-squared Evaluation metrics.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Splitting the data into features and targets and further splitting it into train and test data.
- Finding the correlation between the features.
- Initiating Regression models (i.e., Linear, Lasso, Ridge) and calculating the R-squared score for the same.
- Cross validating the Linear Regression model and calculate the average error in the model.
- Initiating a pipeline for polynomial features and calculate its R-squared score.


### Challenges faced

 - Using 'make_pipeline()' function.
