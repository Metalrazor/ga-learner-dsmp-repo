### Project Overview

 # Insurance Claim Prediction


### Learnings from the project

 - Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Logistic Regression
- Auc score
- Roc AUC plot


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Checking for Outliers in the bmi feature using box plot.
- Checking the correlation between all the features in the dataset using seaborn.pairplot.
- Visualizing the claimants features like no. of children, gender, region and whether smoking or not.
- Making the prediction using Logistic Regression.
- Cross validating the dataset using GridSearchCV function.
- Checking the performance of the classifier model using ROC AUC score.
- Calculating the probability of the predicted values.
- Checking the ROC AUC values for the predicted probabilities.
- Visualizing the AUC curve.
