### Project Overview

 Probability of the Loan Defaulters


### Learnings from the project

 - Independency check.
- Bayes Theorem.
- Visualizing discrete variable.
- Visualizing continuous variable.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Checking for independency between the fico score(Credit score of the borrower) and purpose of the loan.
- Checking for the conditional probability that the customer has paid back the loan given that he/she has complied with the Credit policy.
- Visualizing the 'Probability distribution for the purpose of the loan against the case when the borrower couldn't pay back the loan'.
- Visualizing the frequency of the monthly installments being paid by the borrowers.
- Visualizing the frequency distribution of the annual income of the borrowers.


### Challenges faced

 Applying Bayes theorem on the dataset.
