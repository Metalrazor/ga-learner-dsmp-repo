### Project Overview

 Loan Defaulters Analysis Project

For this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.

The data that we have is for the period from 2007-2010.

Aim of the Project

It is a guided project, aimed at training the learner with industry level dataset. In this project I had the opportunity to learn how to transform and map raw data to an appropriate format.
