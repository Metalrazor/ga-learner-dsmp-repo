### Project Overview

# Lego-set-Analysis

### Learnings from the project

- Train test split.
- Correlation between the features.
- Linear Regression.
- Root Mean Squared Error and R-squared evaluation metrics.

### Approach taken to solve the problem

- Loading and splitting the data into Target and Feature variables.
- Further splitting the data into train and test set using train_test_split() function.
- Checking the correlation between each of the Independent variables with the dependent variable using scatter plots.
- Checking for correlation between the Independent variables and dropping them.
- Creating a Linear Regression model to predict the prices of new lego sets.
- Checking for errors in the model using the sklearn.metrics package.
- Visualizing Residuals in the model.

### Challenges faced

- Checking the correlation between individual features and target variable using scatter plot.
